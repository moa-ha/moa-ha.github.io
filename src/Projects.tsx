          <p>Efficient On-Site Location-Based Employee Scheduling App</p>
          <p>
            This project is from group project from bootcamp, and I am remaking
            from the scratch to consolidate the concepts and make clear code

          Car-GP<p> from April 2024</p>
          <p>
            An app that tracks car maintenance status and calculates upcoming
            maintenance schedules based on individual driving distances, sending
            alerts accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had the idea for this app because I realized I didn't know much
            about cars and wished someone would provide this kind of
            information.

          LyricSync<p>from May 2024</p>
          <p>
            An app that translates song lyrics into the desired language and
            stores them for offline viewing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding lyrics are good tool for learning language, we wanted to
            create an app like a notepad where users can store translated song
            lyrics on their devices, making it accessible offline.
